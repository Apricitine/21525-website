  This year, a new system has been introduced to the engineering club in the form of machine certification. The new system involves members of the team needing to get certified by a mentor (adult) before being able to use and operate machinery in the engineering room. From everything from the sand saw to the slow saw, you now need adult certification before you are allowed to cut through wood or sand down metal. This change is just one demonstration of how the importance of safety will affect how the engineering environment will change at LCHS. So far this change has been taken well as it now enforces that competent users will be the only ones permitted to use dangerous machines. Hopefully this new rule will bring about more approprietly skilled users to machinery and not be an unessesary rule used to show that saftey is important.
