# The Engineering Team of 21525
####Trentan Davé
  Our Engineering division this year is working hard to figure out how to best place pixels accurately as well as place as many pixels as possible on the board. This years team captain, Victor is doing his best to manage contribution to the robot, with teaching and planning for the teams future. One challenge in particular that will be a challenge for this year's team is being able to have a well structured autonomous, that may be able to make mosaics on the board. A mosaic is a pattern of three pixels worth extra points for the team, and if autonomous is able to score a mosaic, that would be a huge advantage for our team. Another challenge for the engineering division is effectively picking up pixels so that our turnaround time for scoring is as low as possible. Quickly being able to grab and drop pixels is very important in this years games much like last years cones. 
  The 21525 engineering team has gained several new members from last years 5921 team. These new engineers are eager to learn more, and it is important that they are able to learn more soon to be the most beneficial to the team! Already the team has created some great ideas for this years games and are exited to see their ideas put to reality. A spinning entrance to quickly grab pixels and strong side beams to carry the robot are just a few of the brainstormed ideas that are coming to reality in the coming weeks!


Meet one in Monrovia is going to be great for teams around the Monrovia area to see how their compedition is able to adapt to a real VEX game!!
